    * ECB
    * CBC
    * CTR
    * GCM
    * CCM
* DRBG
* RSA
* DH
* ECC
    * ECDSA

    * Curve P-192
    * Curve P-224
    * Curve P-256

### OpenSSL Version Caveats

* SHA-3 support is only available with OpenSSL versions 1.1.1+.
* EC_KEY_METHOD is only available with OpenSSL versions 1.1.1+.

## Building

### OpenSSL

```
git clone https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git
cd openssl
./config no-fips
make
sudo make install
```

### wolfSSL

```
git clone https://github.com/wolfssl/wolfssl.git
cd wolfssl
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-cmac --enable-keygen --enable-sha --enable-des3 --enable-aesctr --enable-aesccm --enable-aesgcm --enable-aesgcm-stream CPPFLAGS="-DHAVE_AES_ECB -DWOLFSSL_AES_DIRECT -DWC_RSA_NO_PADDING -DWOLFSSL_PUBLIC_MP -DECC_MIN_KEY_SZ=192"
make
sudo make install
```

Add `--enable-fips=v2` to the configure command above if building from a FIPS bundle and not the git repository.

### wolfEngine

```
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
```

To build using a different OpenSSL installation directory (e.g. one at /usr/local/ssl) use:

```
./configure --with-openssl=/usr/local/ssl
make
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/ssl/lib
make check
```

* To build wolfEngine in single-threaded mode, add `--enable-singlethreaded` to the configure command.
* AES-GCM is disabled by default because of the code changes required to OpenSSL. To enable it, add `--enable-aesgcm`.
* AES-CCM is disabled by default for the same reason. To enable it, add `--enable-aesccm`.
* To disable support for loading wolfEngine dynamically, add `--disable-dynamic-engine`.
* To build a static version of wolfEngine, add `--enable-static`.
* To use a custom user_settings.h file to override the defines produced by `./configure`, add `--enable-usersettings` and place a user_settings.h file with the defines you want in the include directory. See the root of the project for an example user_settings.h.
* To build wolfEngine with debug support, add `--enable-debug`. Then, to activate the debug logging at runtime, your application should send this control command to wolfEngine (denoted "e" here): `ENGINE_ctrl_cmd(e, "enable_debug", 1, NULL, NULL, 0)`.

## Testing

### Unit Tests
To run automated unit tests:

* `make test`

If you get an error like `error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.3` then the library cannot be found. Use the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable as described in the section above.

### Integration Tests
There are no automated integration tests, yet.
